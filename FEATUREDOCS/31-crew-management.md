## Rate Cascade
Assignment rate is resolved in this order:
1. `rateOverride` on the assignment (if set and > 0)
2. `crewMember.defaultDayRate` (daily) or `crewMember.defaultHourlyRate` (hourly)
3. `crewRole.defaultRate` (with role's rate type)
4. Fallback: $0 daily

## Cost Calculation
- **DAILY**: rate × number of days (start to end inclusive)
- **HOURLY**: rate × estimatedHours
- **FLAT**: rate (fixed amount)

## Pages
| Path | Component | Description |
|------|-----------|-------------|
| `/crew` | CrewDashboard / CrewTable | Manager+ sees dashboard with stats, timesheets, assignments, offers; others see crew list |
| `/crew/new` | CrewMemberForm | Create crew member |
| `/crew/[id]` | Detail page | Contact, rates, skills, assignments, availability, certifications, calendar |
| `/crew/[id]/edit` | CrewMemberForm | Edit crew member |
| `/crew/planner` | CrewPlannerPage | 14-day Gantt-style timeline of all crew |
| `/crew/settings` | CrewSettingsPage | Manage roles and skills |

## Project Detail Integration
- **Crew tab** on project detail page (`/projects/[id]`) via `CrewPanel` component
- Assignment list with phase grouping, PM highlighting
- Add/edit assignment dialogs with crew picker, role, phase, dates, rate override
- Status dropdown (Pending → Offered → Accepted → Confirmed → Completed)
- **Labour cost** shown in project financial summary
- **Call Sheet** button in crew tab and Documents dropdown

## Call Sheet PDF
- `src/lib/pdf/call-sheet-pdf.tsx` — landscape A4 document
- API route: `GET /api/documents/call-sheet/[projectId]?date=YYYY-MM-DD`
- Lists all non-cancelled crew sorted by call time then role
- Includes: project info, location, site contact, crew table (name, role, phase, call/wrap times, phone, notes)
- Uses shift-specific times when available for the requested date

## Availability Management (Phase 3)
- Crew member detail page has an "Availability" tab to add/view/remove blocks
- Types: UNAVAILABLE (hard block, red), TENTATIVE (soft, amber), PREFERRED (wants work, green)
- Conflict detection integrated in assignment dialog — shows warnings when assigning crew with conflicts
- Hard conflicts (UNAVAILABLE) shown in red, soft conflicts (TENTATIVE, double-booked) in amber
- Allows override — admin can still assign despite warnings

## Crew Planner
- 14-day Gantt-style timeline at `/crew/planner`
- Shows all active crew with their assignments and availability blocks
- Color-coded cells: primary (assignment), red (unavailable), amber (tentative), green (preferred)
- Sticky crew name column, scrollable date columns
- Weekend/today highlighting
- Tooltip on hover showing project details or availability reason
- Navigation: back/forward by week, "Today" button
- Sidebar: "Planner" link under Crew

## Calendar Integration (Phase 4)

### iCal Feed per Crew Member
- Each crew member can have an iCal feed enabled from their detail page "Calendar" tab
- Feed URL: `GET /api/crew/calendar/[token]` (or `[token].ics`)
- Token is a 32-byte cryptographically random URL-safe base64 string
- No authentication required — the token IS the auth
- Feed contains all CONFIRMED assignments as VEVENT entries
- If shifts exist, one event per shift; otherwise one event per assignment
- Events include: project name, role, phase, location, site contact, notes
- Token can be regenerated (invalidates old URL) or feed can be disabled

### Schema Fields (CrewMember)
- `icalEnabled` — Boolean, default false
- `icalToken` — String, unique, nullable

### Per-Assignment .ics Download
- API route: `GET /api/crew/calendar/assignment/[id]`
- Requires authentication (session-based)
- Downloads a single .ics file for one assignment
- Available from the assignment row actions dropdown in the project crew panel

### Server Actions (`src/server/crew-calendar.ts`)
| Function | Permission | Description |
|----------|-----------|-------------|
| `enableIcalFeed(crewMemberId)` | crew.update | Enable feed + generate token |
| `disableIcalFeed(crewMemberId)` | crew.update | Disable feed (keeps token) |
| `regenerateIcalToken(crewMemberId)` | crew.update | New token, invalidates old URL |
| `getIcalSettings(crewMemberId)` | crew.read | Get icalEnabled + icalToken |
| `getAssignmentIcsData(assignmentId)` | crew.read | Full assignment data for .ics |

### iCal Library (`src/lib/ical.ts`)
- `generateVCalendar(calName, events)` — RFC 5545 compliant VCALENDAR
- `generateVEvent(event)` — single VEVENT with proper line folding
- `buildDateTime(date, time?)` — combine date + optional "HH:mm" time string
- Supports all-day events and timed events

## Communication & Offers (Phase 5)

### Offer Flow
- Admin creates assignment (PENDING) then sends offer via "Send Offer" action
- Status changes: PENDING -> OFFERED (email sent with Accept/Decline links)
- Crew responds via token-based links: OFFERED -> ACCEPTED or DECLINED
- Admin confirms: ACCEPTED -> CONFIRMED (confirmation email sent)
- `responseToken` on CrewAssignment — unique, one-time use, cleared after response

### Email Templates (`src/lib/crew-emails.ts`)
- `crewOfferEmail` — project details + Accept/Decline buttons
- `crewConfirmationEmail` — confirmed assignment details
- `crewCancellationEmail` — cancellation notice
- `crewUpdateEmail` — updated assignment details
- `crewBulkMessageEmail` — freeform message with project context

### Server Actions (`src/server/crew-communication.ts`)
| Function | Permission | Description |
|----------|-----------|-------------|
| `sendCrewOffer(assignmentId)` | crew.update | Send offer email, set status to OFFERED |
| `sendCrewOfferAll(projectId)` | crew.update | Offer all PENDING assignments |

### API Routes
- `GET /api/crew/respond/[token]?action=accept|decline` — Public, token-based response page
- Returns styled HTML confirmation page after updating assignment status

### UI Integration
- **Per-assignment**: "Send Offer" in row actions dropdown (only for PENDING)
- **Bulk**: "Offer All" button (sends to all PENDING with email), "Message" button opens dialog
- **Middleware**: `/api/crew/respond/` added to public routes (no auth required)

## Permissions
Resource `crew` with actions: `read, create, update, delete`
- owner/admin: all
- manager: create, read, update
- member/staff/warehouse/viewer: read

## Crew Dashboard (`src/server/crew-dashboard.ts`)
- Manager/admin/owner only — users with `crew.update` permission see the dashboard; others see the crew table
- **Stats**: active crew, assignments, pending offers, submitted timesheets, hours (7d), expiring certs
- **Pending Timesheets**: approve/dispute individual or bulk from dashboard
- **Active Assignments**: links to project detail
- **Upcoming Shifts**: next 10 scheduled shifts
- **Pending Offers**: send offer directly from dashboard
- **Crew List**: embedded crew table at the bottom

## Integration Points
- **Sidebar**: "Crew" with HardHat icon, sub-items: Planner, Roles & Skills. Gated by `crew` resource
- **Top bar**: `crew` segment label
- **Page commands**: searchable crew page with aliases
- **Global search**: searches first/last name, email, department

- `crewRateTypeLabels`, `assignmentStatusLabels`, `phaseLabels`, `shiftStatusLabels`
- `availabilityTypeLabels`, `timeEntryStatusLabels`

## Time Tracking (Phase 6)

### Data Model — `CrewTimeEntry`
- `id, organizationId, assignmentId? (optional — null for general shifts), crewMemberId`
- `description?` — freeform label for standalone shifts (e.g. "Warehouse maintenance")
- `date, startTime, endTime, breakMinutes, totalHours?`
- `status` — DRAFT, SUBMITTED, APPROVED, DISPUTED, EXPORTED
- `approvedById?, approvedAt?, notes?`
- Indexes: `[organizationId]`, `[assignmentId]`, `[crewMemberId, date]`

### Status Flow
```
DRAFT → SUBMITTED → APPROVED → EXPORTED
                   → DISPUTED → (edit) → DRAFT
```
