# GearFlow

Professional asset and rental management for AV, theatre, and production companies.

## Overview

GearFlow is a multi-tenant SaaS platform that manages the full lifecycle of production equipment — from procurement and inventory tracking through project quoting, warehouse operations, and compliance testing. Built as a modern web application with full mobile/PWA support for warehouse floor operations.

## Features

### Asset Management
- **Serialized assets** — Individual tracking with unique asset tags, QR codes, serial numbers, and full lifecycle status (Available, Checked Out, In Maintenance, Lost, Retired)
- **Bulk assets** — Quantity-tracked consumables and non-serialized items with stock levels and reorder thresholds
- **Equipment models** — Shared templates defining manufacturer, specs, pricing defaults, maintenance intervals, and test & tag requirements
- **Kit system** — Physical containers (road cases, racks) holding fixed sets of serialized and bulk assets. Kits have their own asset tags and check out/in as a unit
- **Categories** — Hierarchical organization with custom icons
- **Auto-incrementing tags** — Configurable prefix, digit count, and counter per organization
- **CSV import/export** — Bulk data operations with flexible column matching
- **Media attachments** — Photos, manuals, and documents with drag-to-reorder and primary selection

### Project & Rental Management
- **Full project lifecycle** — Enquiry → Quoting → Confirmed → Prepping → Checked Out → On Site → Returned → Completed → Invoiced
- **Line items** — Equipment, services, labour, transport, and miscellaneous with per-day/week/flat/hourly pricing
- **Visual grouping** — Drag-and-drop line item groups
- **Subhire tracking** — Third-party equipment with supplier details, optionally shown on client documents

- **Overbooking warnings** — Allowed with explicit confirmation, shown as badges on project lists and all PDF documents
- **Reduced stock detection** — Assets in maintenance or lost reduce effective availability with purple badges
- **Project templates** — Save and reuse equipment lists. Fully isolated from live project queries and availability

### Warehouse Operations
- **Barcode/QR scanning** — Camera-based scanning with audio chime feedback for mobile warehouse use
- **Check out flow** — Scan or select assets to assign to project line items. Kit scanning checks out entire kit contents atomically
- **Check in flow** — Return with condition tracking (Good, Damaged, Missing) that auto-updates asset status
- **Pull sheets** — Online pick list and printable packing list with per-unit checkboxes
- **Conflict detection** — Blocks checkout if asset is already out on another project, showing which one

### Test & Tag (AS/NZS 3760:2022)
- **Equipment register** — Track items with equipment class, appliance type, test intervals
- **Test records** — Visual inspection + electrical tests (earth continuity, insulation, leakage, polarity, RCD trip time)
- **Status lifecycle** — Not Yet Tested → Current → Due Soon → Overdue / Failed / Retired
- **Quick test** — Streamlined single-item test entry

### Maintenance
